## [Project 2: Product Uptake](https://github.com/Wakilu/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/main/Oloyade%20Wakilu%20-%20Predict%20Product%20Uptake%201.ipynb)
The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed.

**Problem statement**
* Predict if the customer will subscribe to a term deposit

## [Project 3: Loan Eligibility for Dream Housing Finance Company](https://github.com/Wakilu/Data_Science_Portfolio__/blob/main/Loan%20Eligibility%20for%20Dream%20Housing%20Finance%20company.ipynb)
Dream Housing Finance is a company that offers various types of home loans, catering to both urban and rural areas. The loan application process begins with the customer applying for a home loan. Subsequently, the company assesses the customer's eligibility for the loan.

The company aims to streamline and automate this loan eligibility assessment in real time. This automation will be based on the information provided by customers when filling out the online application form. This information includes details such as Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and other relevant factors.

To achieve this automation, the company has made available a dataset. The purpose of this dataset is to help identify customer segments that meet the eligibility criteria for a loan. By doing so, the company can strategically target these eligible customers.

**Problem Statement**

It is a classification problem where I have to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. In a classification problem, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variable(s).

Below are some of the factors that can affect the Loan Approval (dependent variable for this loan prediction problem):
* Salary: Applicants with high incomes should have more chances of loan approval.
* Previous history: Applicants who have repaid their previous debts should have higher chances of loan approval.
* Loan amount: Loan approval should also depend on the loan amount. If the loan amount is less, chances of loan approval should be high.
* Loan term: A loan for a shorter time period and less amount should have a higher chance of approval.
* EMI: The lower the amount to be paid monthly to repay the loan, the higher the chances of loan approval.
  
These are the factors (not limited to ) that can be helpful in deciding whether the loan should be approved or not.
