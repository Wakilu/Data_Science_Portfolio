## [Project 2: Product Uptake](https://github.com/Wakilu/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/main/Oloyade%20Wakilu%20-%20Predict%20Product%20Uptake%201.ipynb)
The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed.

**Problem statement**
* Predict if the customer will subscribe to a term deposit

## [Project 3: Loan Eligibility for Dream Housing Finance Company](https://github.com/Wakilu/Data_Science_Portfolio__/blob/main/Loan%20Eligibility%20for%20Dream%20Housing%20Finance%20company.ipynb)
Dream Housing Finance is a company that offers various types of home loans, catering to both urban and rural areas. The loan application process begins with the customer applying for a home loan. Subsequently, the company assesses the customer's eligibility for the loan.

The company aims to streamline and automate this loan eligibility assessment in real time. This automation will be based on the information provided by customers when filling out the online application form. This information includes details such as Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and other relevant factors.

To achieve this automation, the company has made available a dataset. The purpose of this dataset is to help identify customer segments that meet the eligibility criteria for a loan. By doing so, the company can strategically target these eligible customers.

**Problem Statement**

It is a classification problem where I have to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. In a classification problem, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variable(s).

Below are some of the factors that can affect the Loan Approval (dependent variable for this loan prediction problem):
* Salary: Applicants with high incomes should have more chances of loan approval.
* Previous history: Applicants who have repaid their previous debts should have higher chances of loan approval.
* Loan amount: Loan approval should also depend on the loan amount. If the loan amount is less, chances of loan approval should be high.
* Loan term: A loan for a shorter time period and less amount should have a higher chance of approval.
* EMI: The lower the amount to be paid monthly to repay the loan, the higher the chances of loan approval.
  
These are the factors (not limited to ) that can be helpful in deciding whether the loan should be approved or not.

## [Project 4: EDA on Lagos House Prices](https://github.com/Wakilu/Basic-EDA-on-Lagos-House-Prices-Data-Set/blob/main/Beginner%20EDA%20%20Work%20Book%20-%20Lagos%20House%20Prices%20Set.ipynb)
The dataset contains 5336 records of rental properties around 7 districts in Lagos. The data was sourced from a Nigerian real estate company website.

## [Project 5: World University Rankings EDA](https://github.com/Wakilu/Data_Science_Portfolio__/blob/main/EDA%20World%20University%20Rankings.ipynb)
The QS World University Rankings is an annual report that evaluates and ranks global universities, published by Quacquarelli Symonds. This ranking is endorsed by the International Ranking Expert Group (IREG) and is considered one of the three most extensively followed university rankings worldwide, alongside the Academic Ranking of World Universities and the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) is a UK-based company that specializes in assessing higher education institutions across the globe.

The dataset was obtained by scraping the QS World University Rankings website with Python and Selenium.

## [Project 6: Amazon Web Scraper Project](https://github.com/Wakilu/Data_Science_Portfolio__/blob/main/Amazon%20Web%20Scraper%20Project.ipynb)
Web scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications. There are many different ways to perform web scraping to obtain data from websites. These include using online services, particular APIs or even creating code for web scraping from scratch.

Web scraping requires two parts, namely the crawler and the scraper. The crawler is an artificial intelligence algorithm that browses the web to search for the particular data required by following the links across the internet. The scraper, on the other hand, is a specific tool created to extract data from the website. The design of the scraper can vary greatly according to the complexity and scope of the project so that it can quickly and accurately extract the data. In this project, I created my code to scrape data from the Amazon website from scratch.

## [Project 7: Computer Vision]()
Computer vision in data science is a multidisciplinary field that leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to enable computers to understand and interpret visual information. It has a wide range of applications across industries and continues to advance rapidly as technology and algorithms improve.

Data science often starts by preprocessing images to enhance their quality and extract relevant features. This may involve tasks like resizing, filtering, and noise reduction to improve the accuracy of subsequent analyses. 

One of the key steps in computer vision is feature extraction. This involves identifying specific characteristics or patterns within an image that are relevant to the task at hand. Features can be as basic as edges or corners, or as complex as deep neural network representations.

Machine learning and deep learning techniques are commonly used in computer vision to build models that can learn from data and make predictions or classifications. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly powerful for image-related tasks and have driven many recent advances in computer vision.
